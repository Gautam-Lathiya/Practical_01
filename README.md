# Practical_01

This solution contains Calculator and DebuggingApplication Console apps.

## Projects

### 1. Calculator

The Calculator project is a simple C# application that provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### Description

The Calculator project is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It includes a console application that interacts with the user to read input numbers and perform the desired operations. The project demonstrates the use of static class and methods and exception handling in C#.

#### Features

- **Addition** of two integers
- **Subtraction** of two integers
- **Multiplication** of two integers
- **Division** of two integers with error handling for division by zero

#### Technology

- .NET Framework 4.7.2
- C# 7.3

#### How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter two integers.
2. The application performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the entered numbers.
3. The results of the operations are displayed to the user.
4. If the user attempts to divide by zero, an appropriate error message is displayed.

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
